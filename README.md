# SavageDOM - [![Builds](https://api.travis-ci.org/repositories/molisani/SavageDOM?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/molisani/SavageDOM)
Object-oriented, DOM-wrapping SVG manipulation library written in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Installation

- Direct downloads: [SavageDOM.js](./dist/SavageDOM.js), [SavageDOM.d.ts](./dist/SavageDOM.d.ts)
- `npm install SavageDOM --save`
- `bower install SavageDOM --save`

### Usage

The library is distributed as an ES6 AMD module. The documentation can be found [here](https://molisani.github.io/SavageDOM/index.html), but due to TypeDoc's poor support for TypeScript 2.1 features it is always good to revert to the definition file.
